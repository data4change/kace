Sudan Public Opinion Poll
Results of the first phase
February 2015
 

This report consists the main results of the public opinion poll 2014 in Khartoum state. The opinion poll is on general satisfaction of the citizens of Khartoum state. The results were gathered in the field through direct structured interviews in the 7 localities of Khartoum state. The sample size for the survey was determined by the accuracy and degree of precision required for the survey estimates for each locality and available resources. The interviews were carried out by qualified well trained young researchers. 

With this project, KACE intended to address the issue of transparency, accountability and governance in Sudan. This opinion poll has created opportunity for a better informed electorate. In collecting people’s opinion on the quality of public services, employment, education and government policies in Sudan, KACE is advocating for better services. 

By building awareness of what is going on across the local community this project intended to help in establishing a foundation for a civic national consciousness. Civil society organizations and all those exposed to this survey benefited from this project by providing with facts about the opinions of the Khartoum state people rather than on stereotypes, rumors and unsubstantiated claims. 

Civic identity, which requires a healthy civil society, is important in maintaining a cohesive state apparatus, especially one that governs as diverse a population as that of Sudan. Civil society organizations require reliable information in order to direct their energies more effectively. To reach the objective of a better informed civil society there must be a space for individual expression and a way to relay accurate information on how Sudanese citizens feel to these CSOs. Due to censorship by the central government, free expression of thought and opinion on Sudanese television, print media, internet, radio and other outlets is lacking. This does not, however, mean dialogue on social topics cannot occur.

Private research institutions that implemented opinion poll in Sudan were neither able to publish their research nor disclose the identities of their patrons as they are bound by law and good business sense not to. Business and corruption go hand in hand, of course, and the result is a conflict of interest wherein economic and political elites capitalize on research at the expense of the average Sudanese citizen. For these reasons transparency and accuracy of data and analysis are of paramount importance. This project intended also to establish a model for other independent researchers to contribute to the knowledge of Sudan and its people. 

Sudan faces a mix of political, economic and security challenges, all of which are probably to intensify as the election grow near. The ongoing discussions about how to make progress includes approaches such as national dialogues. These can be part of a broader political reform process that involves all groups, and addresses governance, diversity and reconciliation.

This report divided into seven sections that covers the core issues concerning Sudanese people, such as public and government services, socioeconomic situation of Sudanese (poverty, unemployment, etc.), economic situation of Sudan, security and conflict situation, corruption, democracy, national dialogue, etc. the sections are: 

1.	Socioeconomic situation (family, country, price of services)
2.	Security  (neighborhood, country)
3.	Problems facing country
4.	Emigration 
5.	Locality services (general, health, education)
6.	Corruption (spread, measures against)
7.	Democracy (general, national dialogue)

**1.2	Sample and Survey Methodology**
***a)	Sample design***

The sample for the survey was designed to provide estimates on some key indicators of specific issues concerning Sudanese people, such as public and government services, socioeconomic situation of Sudanese (poverty, unemployment, etc.), economic situation of Sudan, security and conflict situation, corruption, democracy, national dialogue, etc. This is at Khartoum state and for its 7 localities (Karari, Omdurman, Ombadda, Shareq Elneel, Bahri, Khartoum and Jabal Awlieya). The target universe for the survey includes the households and members of individual households. The population living in institutions and group quarters such as hospitals, military bases and prisons, were excluded from the sampling frame.

The localities constituted the main sampling domains and in each locality a two stage cluster sampling design was employed to draw the sample for the survey. The villages or quarters (in the case of urban areas) constituted the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). The PSU represents the smallest area or administrative unit which could be identified in the field with commonly recognized boundaries. The sampling frame for the 7 localities was compiled using the list of villages and quarters and estimated number of households updated by the Central Bureau of Statistics on the basis of the updated frame from the 2008 population census. The 7 localities clusters (PSUs) were distributed to urban and rural areas, proportional to the size of urban and rural households in each locality. The urban and rural clusters in each of these localities were selected randomly with probability of selection proportional to size (PPS). 


***b)	Sample size and Sample selection procedures***
The sample size for the survey was determined by the accuracy and degree of precision required for the survey estimates for each locality and available resources (see annex). It was judged that a minimum sample of 782 households would be necessary to make estimates/results with some degree of precision at the locality level (see table 1 below).  

Since a similar level of precision was required for the survey results from each locality, it was decided to draw 34 clusters from each locality and 23 households from each cluster. The sampling frame of villages/quarters was compiled separately for each locality based on the best available population measures. In cases where a selected village/quarter could not be reached because of security or access problems, it was replaced by a neighboring village/quarter in the sampling frame. 

All selected clusters (villages/quarters) in each locality were covered. A sample of 23 households was drawn from each selected cluster using the method of systematic with random start and for each selected household the interview was conducted with the head of the household and one member selected randomly if his/her age 18 years or over. 

***c)	Training of data collectors***
Two 4 day long training workshops were organized for 60 data collectors at TRACS. The training lasted 4 days and covered research methodology in general as well as interviewing techniques, how to ask questions and fill in the questionnaire. An additional day was reserved to conduct a pilot test of the questionnaire. The data collectors selected were either university students or recent graduates with an interest in social science and research. They come from the different localities of Khartoum and represent the country’s ethnic and socio-economic diversity. 

The first group of data collectors were trained from Monday 12- 15 May, and the second group from 17-20th May. Out of the 54 trained 40 were selected for the polling field work. The intention of the training is to select youth who are interested in social science research and to build their capacity so that they can further conduct their own studies while also serving as a resource to the center in case of future surveys and other field work. A representative sample of data collectors was selected from the 7 localities of Khartoum so they can carry out the polling questionnaire in their own communities. 

***d)	Ethics and consents procedure***
Selection of respondents in sample villages/quarters required official consultation with the villages/quarters authorities. After respondents were randomly selected in each sample villages/quarters, interviewers were then required to formally introduce themselves and the purpose of the interviews.  During this introductory phase, the respondents were informed that all responses would be noted down but would be kept confidential at all times. Respondents were informed that they could choose to or not to participate in the survey.

***e)	Data entry and data analysis***
The data entry application was developed using Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) software package. Five data entry operators (four females and one male) with previous experience on CSPro were recruited and were given refreshing sessions on data entry/verification and data modification using actual survey data. After completing data entry for the seven localities of Khartoum state, the concatenated data file was edited to resolve inconsistencies and exported to SPSS for further analysis.


 

Section 1: Assessment of the socioeconomic situation
----------------------------------------------------

The section presents a range of indicators designed to reflect the attitudes of people of Khartoum state towards the main issues of their own lives, societies and country.
