# KACE
KACEâ€™s vision is to see a peaceful democratic and truly multi-cultural Sudan, where all people are equal in dignity, rights, and opportunities. Our objective is to contribute to the empowerment of target groups by providing them with skills that enable them to participate and interact in public affairs, and to improve the standard and quality of their lives.
