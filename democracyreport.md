Sudan Public Opinion Poll
Results of the Election opinion Poll, 
in Khartoum, River Nile, Kassala, North Kordofan, Aljazeera and White Nile States 


April 2015
 

1. Introduction
---------------

**1.1 Background** 
This report includes the main results of the public opinion poll on the current election 2015 in six states of Sudan’s 18 states. The opinion poll reflects the general public’s satisfaction with what the government of Sudan calls “the citizens’ constitutional rights” to chose their president and parliament representatives. The six states where this survey was carried out are Khartoum, River Nile, Kassala, North Kordofan, Aljazeera and White Nile States. The results were gathered in the field through direct structured interviews covered all localities of the surveyed states. The sample size for the survey was determined by the accuracy, and degree of precision required for the survey estimates for each state and available resources. The interviews were carried out by 75 qualified young researchers managed by 9 supervisors. 

The April 2015 elections took place against the backdrop of deep political polarization in the country. The polarization came as a result of 25 years of bad governance; with the headlines of war, oppression and poverty. The government ignored all the calls and demands by the opposition parties to postpone the elections until the national dialogue, which was declared by the president, is carried out and concluded its outcomes. Nevertheless the ruling party pressed with the elections. The main opposition parties of the “National Consensus Forces” declared that they would be boycotting the elections, leaving only the ruling NCP and its satellites of small splinter groups from the two main parties (5 Umma parties and 4 Democratic Unionist parties) to contest it. 

The African Union Commission (AUC) sent a pre-election assessment mission to Khartoum early March 2015. The overall objective of the mission is “to consider the state of preparedness for the polls by all stakeholders and examine the context within which the election will take place to ensure that they are held within the framework of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance to which Sudan is a signatory”. The findings of this mission were published in a report a few days later. 

The report states that ‘the necessary conditions and environment for the holding of transparent, competitive, free and fair elections as agreed in the AU principles governing democratic elections have not been satisfied.’ The report puts the blame squarely on the government: ‘The existing government’s security measures put substantial restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly and do not provide an environment for free participation in the electoral process.’ 

The report recommended that “The planned elections be postponed and the national dialogue be prioritized. That will allow more time to for the creation of an enable environment for credible, transparent and competitive elections”.

Through this project, KACE intended to address the issue of transparency, accountability and governance in Sudan. This opinion poll has created opportunity for better-informed Sudanese citizens about the election process. In collecting people’s opinion on the elections, KACE is trying to provide accurate information that helps analysts understand the dynamics of the elections and how the average individual perceives the election process. By raising awareness of what is going on across the local community this project is hoped to contribute to establishing a foundation for civic education. 

Civil society organizations and all those who receive the results of this survey will benefit from this project by getting the “facts” about the opinions of the people in the six surveyed states about the elections rather than “rumours”, “allegations”, “unsubstantiated claims” and “counter-claims”. Democracy as a concept is wider than the elections processes, and a well-informed public is essential for real democracy. Independent civil society, among other things, is vital for civic education, and needless to say that all this needs an enabling open and healthy public space, which can only exist where there is good governance. 
Civil society, as well as all other institutions, requires reliable information in order to be able to direct their energies more effectively. 

To reach the objective of a better informed civil society there must be a space for individuals to freely express their opinions and access to information for Sudanese citizens. To the contrary, freedom of expression and freedom thought and opinion in Sudan are severely restricted. The government controls television, radio, print materials and all other media outlets. The only media outlet left for independent voices is the online media, and even this suffers attacks such as hacking, and sometimes shut down the Internet. That being said, this does not mean dialogue on social topics cannot occur; independent voices find ways to express themselves; this project is one of these ways.

The pre-elections questions that we asked the public are as follows: 

1.	Have you heard that there is a forthcoming election in April 2015?
2.	Do you know the type of the coming election (Presidential, Parliamentary National, at state level?
3.	Do you know the candidates for the Presidential election?
4.	Are you registered to vote for the election?
5.	Did you vote in the previous election (2010)?
6.	Are you planning to vote in this election?
7.	Did you hear, that some parties are boycotting the election?
8.	Do you believe that this election will be free/honest/transparent?  

**1.2 Sample and Survey Methodology**
***a)	Sample design***
The sample for the survey was designed to provide estimates on some key indicators at State level and mode of living for the 6 states (River Nile, Kassala, Khartoum, Jazeera, White Nile, and Northern Kordofan). The target universe for the survey includes the households and members of individual households. The population living in institutions and group quarters such as hospitals, military bases and prisons, were excluded from the sampling frame.

The state constituted the main sampling domain and in each state a two-stage cluster sampling design was employed to draw the sample for the survey. The villages or quarters (in the case of urban areas) constituted the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). The PSU represents the smallest area or administrative unit, which could be identified in the field with commonly recognized boundaries. 

The sampling frame for the 6 states was compiled using the list of villages and quarters and estimated number of households updated by the Central Bureau of Statistics on the basis of the updated frame from the 2008 population census. The 6 states clusters (PSUs) were distributed to urban and rural areas, proportional to the size of urban and rural households in each state. The urban and rural clusters in each of these states were selected randomly with probability of selection proportional to size (PPS). 

**b) Sample size and Sample selection procedures**
The sample size for the survey was determined by the accuracy and degree of precision required for the survey estimates for each state and available resources. It was judged that a minimum sample of 800 households would be necessary to make estimates/results with some degree of precision at the state level.  

Since a similar level of precision was required for the survey results from each state, it was decided to draw 40 clusters from each state and 25 households from each cluster (1,000 households per state). The sampling frame of villages/quarters was compiled separately for each state based on the best available population measures. In cases where a selected village/quarter could not be reached because of security or access problems, it was replaced by a neighbouring village/quarter in the sampling frame. A sample of 25 households was drawn from each selected cluster using the method of systematic random sampling and for each selected household the interview was conducted with one member selected randomly if his/her age is 18 years or over. 

***c) Training of data collectors***
Three 4-day-training workshops were organized for 75 data collectors and 9 supervisors at TRACKS. The training lasted 4 days and covered research methodology in general, as well as, interviewing techniques, how to ask questions and fill in the questionnaire. An additional day was reserved to conduct a pilot test of the questionnaire. The data collectors selected were either university students or recent graduates with an interest in social science and research. They come from the different localities of Khartoum and representative of the country’s ethnic and socio-economic diversity. 
 

***d) Ethics and consent procedure***
Selection of respondents in sample villages/quarters required official consultation with the villages/quarters’ authorities. After respondents were randomly selected in each of the sample villages/quarters, interviewers were then required to formally introduce themselves and the purpose of the interviews. During this introductory phase, the respondents were informed that all responses would be noted down but would be kept confidential at all times. Respondents were informed that they could choose whether or not to participate in the survey.

***e) Data entry and data analysis***
The data entry application was developed using Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) software package. Five data entry operators (four females and one male) with previous experience on CSPro were recruited and were given refreshing sessions on data entry/verification and data modification using actual survey data.

After completing data entry for the seven localities of Khartoum state, the concatenated data file was edited to resolve inconsistencies and exported to SPSS for further analysis.



2. Polling results
------------------

**2.1	Awareness of the election:** 
85% of the total respondents in the surveyed states were aware of the election. Kassala scored the highest percentage, where 95% of the people were aware of the election and the lowest is Northern Kordofan, where only 73% of the population were aware of the elections. 

Although the percentage of awareness seems to be very high, particularly in Kassala, this does not confirm that the respondents actually understand what a democratic system is or the values that comes with such a system. In some random interviews form the surveyors with many in Kassala state, people expressed that they knew about the election from their tribal leaders. However, the tribal leaders only speak of the NCP; implying that just because a respondent is aware of the election does not mean they are aware of the dynamics of the elections or the implications of electing a specific party/president. They hear about the elections from the radio, in the market and social events but their knowledge of the elections does not go beyond knowing of the election itself.

 
**2.2 Knowledge about the type of the coming election**

47% of the total respondents in the six surveyed states know the type of this election. Again the highest percentage of the respondents is from Kassala followed by River Nile State with 66%, all respondents from other surveyed states who know the type of election are less than 50%.

The general trend reveals that the awareness and knowledge of the type of the election is directly proportional to the mode of living (urban, rural), level of education and age of the respondent (see annex 2, 3 and 4). In Kassala State 60% of illiterates and 94% of respondents with a university level education and above were aware of the elections. The 60% reported by illiterates seems to be very high for an illiterate sample group, however, an explanation for this can be that illiterates know the fact, the fact being the different types of elections (Presidential, Parliamentary, National), but do not understand what the dynamics in the election types are, or the processes that are carried out in the different election types, compared to the 94% that most probably do understand the dynamics and processes in the three different election types.
 

**2.3 Election Candidates** 
The majority of the respondents (more than 50%) in five states (Khartoum, River Nile, White Nile, Jazeera and North Kordofan) do not know that there are other candidates than the current president, except in Kassala State the percentage of respondents who know that there are other candidates than the current president  is 64%. 

**2.4 Election Registration** 
In River Nile and Kassala states the percentage of the respondent who registered is also much higher than other surveyed states (79% and 73% respectively). As it is mentioned above this does not confirm that the respondents actually understand what a democratic system is or the values that comes with such a system. This specifically valid for Kassala State.  
 
In all surveyed states the people who participated in the previous election is much higher than the people who are planning to vote in this election, except the River Nile State where the percentage of people who are planning to vote is higher than the percentage of people who voted in the previous election. This is clearly justifiable, as it is observed from the surveyors that there is a massive campaign for the election.

**2.5 Boycotting of the election**
Consistent with the observation illustrated above that the majority of the respondents of the six state don’t know there is other candidates than the current president (specifically in Kassala), and the majority (60% in total) didn’t hear that some parties are boycotting the election. Again the highest percentage is from Kassala (72%).    

 
**2.6 Fairness of the Election**
The majority of the respondents in five states (Khartoum, White Nile, North Kordofan, Jazeera and Kassala) don’t believe that the election process will be fair, honest and transparent. However in River Nile the result is different, where 66% of the respondents believe that the election will be fair, honest and transparent. This is also consistent of the above mentioned results of their registration and the planning to vote. The River Nile State population are working hard to get their candidates wining the election.
